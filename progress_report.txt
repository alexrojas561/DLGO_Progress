1. Intro
    - Different uses for deep learning
    - Chess vs Go -> show complexity of the problem
    - Pros + cons of machine learning -> highlight traditional methods

2. Data Description + Summary
    - Smart Game Format (SGF)
    - Encode to machine-readable format
    - Zobrist hashing
    - Train a deep neural network

3. Questions you plan to address in your project?
    - What makes a good game ai
    - What are the limitations of these various methods
    - How does combining methods improve the ai

4. Statistical models you plan to use
    - Tree Search
        - Bruteforce minimax search
        - Alpha-beta pruning
        - Monte Carlo search

    - Neural Networks
        - Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
        - Policy gradients
        - Q-learning
        - Asynchronous Actor-critic

    - AI comparison
        - Anova or sample tests
        - Win/Losses

5. Some initial Results (Answer on Friday - Ask Niu)
    -

6. Your plan for the full project
    - Each method is powerful but limited
    - Combine everything to make a strong ai
    - Talk about architecture if enough time/space
